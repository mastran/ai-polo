As XR technologies have evolved, they have opened the doors to creating experiences that can combine real and virtual
world to give rise to a new form of reality called Mixed Real- ity. Theatre, a live narrative experience is often 
constrained to use the props and visual effects that can only be made practical with tangible resources or using very 
limited digital projections. The Mixed reality theatre project aims to pro- vide a way for the audience to experience 
the theatre magic at its peak with some props or practical effects replaced by purely virtual ones, that the audience 
can experience with a HoloLens. The resulting performance would increase the amount of immersion in comparison to a 
normal theatre production.

The project can be viewed as a combination of a viewing HoloLens application and an external control application. 
While the viewing app anchors the holograms to World posi- tions and controls their appearance in varying backgrounds 
and lighting, the control application provides an external con- trol to display or remove holograms from the scene among
 other settings. The creation of the view hierarchy, formation of relationships among different components such as 
 anchors and holograms, displaying in a shared space, and lighting are put together in the Unity editor. The bulk of the
  setup is made easier by the comfortably abstracted Mixed Reality Toolkit, which provides higher level APIs and 
  wrappers for HoloLens development. With our work, the audience will be able to view interactions between real world 
  objects and virtual props and effects, resulting in a unique live theatre experience.
